# sofvfx
 Video converter for ASCII display.

# Setup
To use sofvfx, you will need to download [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
When done, open the downloaded `.zip`, go to `/bin/` and copy the three binaries into a `/ffmpeg/` folder inside the project.
If you cloned this repository directly, you will have to create that folder yourself.

After that, simply run the project (or the `.jar` using `java sofvfx.jar -jar`) and wait until the process is finished. 
Have fun~!
